"IQ.SCI.OVRL","Statistical Capacity score (Overall average)","The Statistical Capacity Indicator is a composite score assessing the capacity of a country’s statistical system. It is based on a diagnostic framework assessing the following areas: methodology; data sources; and periodicity and timeliness. Countries are scored against 25 criteria in these areas, using publicly available information and/or country input. The overall Statistical Capacity score is then calculated as a simple average of all three area scores on a scale of 0-100.","World Bank, Bulletin Board on Statistical Capacity (http://bbsc.worldbank.org).",
